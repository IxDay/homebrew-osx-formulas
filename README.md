# BackMarket OSX-Formulas

## How do I install these formulae?

Since we are using a private repository to store our formulas you will have
to run the following command to set it up in brew:
`brew tap backmarket/osx-formulas git@github.com:BackMarket/homebrew-osx-formulas.git`

Then you should be able to run `brew install <formula>`. For e.g: `brew install linux-on-mac`

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
